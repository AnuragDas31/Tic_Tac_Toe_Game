This is a Front-end project using HTML, CSS and JavaScript which is like the traditional Tic_Tac_Toe Game(a bi-player game) wherein one player gets to choose either a 'X' and the other player a 'O' and whoever gets their elements aligned in a single line(verticaly, horizontally or diagonally) wins. The structure is made with the help of HTML and styling by CSS whereas the logic is built using JavaScript language.
